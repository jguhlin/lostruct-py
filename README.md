# lostruct-py

This is a reimplementation of lostruct from the original code: [lostruct](https://github.com/petrelharp/local_pca),
by [Joseph Guhlin](https://github.com/jguhlin) with assistance by [Peter Ralph](https://github.com/petrelharp).

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3997106.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3997106) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jguhlin/lostruct-py/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/jguhlin/lostruct-py)

# Demonstration
Please see the [Example Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jguhlin/lostruct-py/blob/master/Lostruct%20Example.ipynb)

# Installation
Lostruct-py is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/lostruct/)
```pip install lostruct``` is the easiest way to get started.

# Usage

## Input Files
Inputs should be a set of markers in BCF or VCF format. Both should be indexed as appropriate (see: bcftools index). Filtering before running this analysis is strongly suggested (Allele frequency, SNPs only, missingness, etc).

# Citing
If you use this version, plesae cite it via Zenodo [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3997106](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3997106)
as well as the original paper describing the method:

```

## CyVCF2
This project also uses [cyvcf2](https://github.com/brentp/cyvcf2) for fast VCF processing and should be cited:

```

# Changes from Lostruct R package
Please note numpy and R are different when it comes to row-major vs. column-major. Essentially, many things in the python version will be transposed from R.

# Requirements
Python >= 3.6 (may work with older versions). Developed on Python 3.8.5

* numba
* numpy
* cyvcf2

CyVCF2 requires zlib-dev, libbz2-dev, libcurl-dev, liblzma-dev; numa requires libllvm.
These may be installed with `conda` or `pip`, e.g. by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Changes
See [CHANGES.MD](CHANGES.md) for the full list.

## 0.0.5 (pending)
* Smallest circle
* Better in-built JAX support

## 0.0.4
* Package name changed to lostruct
* Parallelization of get_pc_dists
* Implementation of fastmath parameter for get_pc_dists

# Tests

Tests were derived from the [Medicago HapMap data](http://www.medicagohapmap.org/downloads/Mt40/Mt4.0_HapMap_README.pdf). The python package and the R package have high correlation of values. If values begin to deviate, theese tests will now fail.

To run tests simply do:
```
pip install pytest
pytest --benchmark-disable tests/test_fns.py
```
The tests furthermore require `unittest` and `scikit-bio` (and `pytest` to run them this way).

## Benchmarks
To run tests with benchmarks, install the following:
```
pip install pytest-benchmark
```

Then run ```pytest``

## TOX
Tox allows you run tests with multiple versions of the python interpreter in venvs. It is best to use pyenv to install multiple versions python to run before submitting pull requests to be certain tests complete successfully across all versions.

To run tests via tox:
```
pip install tox

```

# Correlation Data
To test correlation of results between the R and Python versions we used data from the Medicago HapMap project, specifically SNPs for sister taxa chromsome 1, processed, and run with LoStruct R.

## Data
```bcftools annotate chr1-filtered-set-2014Apr15.bcf -x INFO,FORMAT | bcftools view -a -i 'F_MISSING<=0.2' | bcftools view -q 0.05 -q 0.95 -m2 -M2 -a -Oz -o chr1-filtered.vcf.gz```

## Lostruct Processing
```Rscript run_lostruct.R -t SNP -s 95 -k 10 -m 10 -i data/```

Run 21 Aug 2020, using lostruct R git hash: 444b8c64bebdf7cdd0323e7735ccadddfc1c8989

This generates the mds_coords.tsv that is used in the correlation comparison. Additionally, the existing tests cover correlation.

To test the weight generation, a random sample of weights was created and used. Output was moved to `lostruct-results/weights_mds_coords.csv` and generated with the random_weights.txt found in `test_data/random_weights.txt`.

```./run_lostruct.R -i data -t snp -s 95 -k 10 -m 10 -w random_weights.txt```

# FAQ / Notes

## Future
Currently the end-user is expected to save the outputs. But would be good to save it in a similar way to lostruct R-code. Please open an issue if you need this.

## Feature Completeness with R implementation
We are not yet feature complete with the R implementation. If something is needed please check for existing issues and comment about your need.

## PCA, MDS, PCoA
PCoA returns the same results as lostruct's MDS implementation (cmdscale). In the example Jupyter notebook you can see the correlation is R =~ 0.998. Some examples of other methods of clustering / looking at differences are included in the notebook.

## Speed and Memory
NUMBA and CyVCF2 are used for speeding up processes, and the software becomes multithreaded by default. The Sparse library is used to reduce memory requirements. parse_vcf function is multithreaded. Distance calculation is not.

### tl;dr of below
Below two options are offered, fastmath for get_pc_dists function, and method="fsvd" for pcoa. When using both you will see a performance increase and memory requirement decrease. Accuracy should decrease, but the absolute correlation we see with our test dataset remains ~0.998. Be aware when using fsvd the sign of the correlation may change.

### JAX
Jax is an open-source library.... optional support in lostruct. Allows for processing on GPU and TPU (untested here, so far). See [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can enable it in the function get_pc_dists by setting jax=True. This results in XX% speedup. Fastmath (below) and JAX are both supported, although JAX outperforms fastmath.

### Fastmath
Additionally, a mode implemented Numba's "fastmath" is available. For the function get_pc_dists set fastmath=True. This results in a ~8% speed boost with very little change in the final output (correlation to R code output remains >= 0.995). This was benchmarked on the Medicago data used in the jupyter notebook using timeit, with 100 repeats with fastmath=False and Fastmath=True.
```get_pc_dists(result, fastmath=True)```

The difference with fastmath=True and leaving it off can be seen [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jguhlin/lostruct-py/master/benchmark_0.0.4-Get_PCs_Dists.svg).

If you need to limit thread usage, please see [Numba's guide](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/threading-layer.html#setting-the-number-of-threads)

### Very Large Datasets
The R implementation handles very large datasets in less memory. The problem arises with the PCoA function. A metric MDS using sklearn may work. Another alternative would be to export the data and run cmdscale in R directly.

The sklearn MDS function differs from the scikit-bio function, here we focus on the scikit-bio version.

There are two options in python for this as well:
```pcoa(method="fsvd", ...)```
Which reduces memory and increases speed, at the cost of some accuracy.

```pcoa(inplace=True, ...)```
Centers a distance matrix in-place, further reducing memory requirements.

```pcoa(number_of_dimensions=10)```
Returns only the first 10 dimensions (configurable) of the scaling. This has no real effect if method is default or manuially set to "eigh" as the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are all calculated, so all are calculated and this becomes a truncation.

You can see the difference between method="fsvd" and method="eigh" (default) [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jguhlin/lostruct-py/master/benchmark_0.0.4-PCoA.svg). These are tested with a minimum of 50 rounds. Note: Downloading the file will allow you to see more detailed information, as some javascript is contained in the SVG but disabled on GitHub.

Using all three techniques, correlation is maintained although the sign may change.
```
mds = pcoa(pc_dists, method="fsvd", inplace=True, number_of_dimensions=10)
np.corrcoef(mds.samples["PC1"], mds_coords['MDS1'].to_numpy())[0][1]
-0.9978147088087447
```

# Miscellaneous Notes

We are using the code formatter [BLACK](https://github.com/psf/black). Also, code coverage is actually 100% but numba JIT'd code is not properly counted. As long as all tests complete everything is working.
